Excited to Share My Currency Converter Project!

After diving into JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Fetch API, I challenged myself to build a complete currency converter application using a free API.

Project Journey:

Crafting the Foundation:
I started with an HTML file to define the application's basic structure.
Simple CSS styling provided a user-friendly layout.
Adding Functionality:
JavaScript brought the application to life:
Users can input desired amount and select currencies.
The Fetch API retrieves exchange rates from a free API.
Calculations convert the input amount to the target currency.
Converted amount is displayed clearly.
Thank You
